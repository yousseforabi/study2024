            <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, with a diameter more than 11 times that of Earth. It's a gas giant composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, lacking a solid surface, and it features the Great Red Spot, a massive storm larger than Earth that has persisted for centuries. Jupiter has the strongest magnetic field of any planet, which creates an extensive magnetosphere. The planet has at least 79 moons, including the four large Galilean moons, with Ganymede being the largest moon in the solar system. Despite its size, Jupiter rotates rapidly, with a day lasting just 10 hours. It also has a faint ring system made of dust, which is difficult to observe. The planet's gravity is about 2.5 times stronger than Earth's. Jupiter has been visited by several spacecraft, including NASA's Juno, which is currently studying the planet's atmosphere and magnetic field</p>

            Saturn is the second-largest planet in our solar system, known for its stunning ring system, which is the most extensive and complex of any planet. Like Jupiter, Saturn is a gas giant primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, with no solid surface. It has a diameter about 9.5 times that of Earth and a day that lasts roughly 10.7 hours due to its fast rotation. Saturn has at least 83 moons, with Titan being the largest, even bigger than the planet Mercury. The planet's magnetic field is weaker than Jupiter's but still significant. Saturn's low density means it could float in water, as it's less dense than any other planet. The planet has been explored by several spacecraft, most notably the Cassini mission, which provided extensive data about its rings, moons, and atmosphere.

                Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is unique for its extreme axial tilt of about 98 degrees, meaning it essentially rotates on its side. This causes extreme seasonal variations as each pole gets about 42 years of continuous sunlight followed by 42 years of darkness. Uranus is an ice giant, composed mainly of water, ammonia, and methane ices, with hydrogen and helium in its atmosphere. The methane gives the planet its distinct blue-green color. Uranus has a diameter about four times that of Earth and has 27 known moons, with Titania being the largest. It also has a faint ring system, though less prominent than Saturn's. The planet's magnetic field is unusual, tilted and offset from its center. Uranus was the first planet discovered with a telescope, by William Herschel in 1781, and was visited by Voyager 2 in 1986, providing most of the current knowledge about the planet.
